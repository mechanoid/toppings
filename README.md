## Welcome to Toppings

The toppings project provides a basic generator set to create and maintain a generic structure for your css based application or framework frontend. Though the structure may be not final yet, it offers a great way of staying clean in your development base and lets you concentrate on the hard and heavy styling itself.

In the last few years a lot of work was done about frontend development via css which includes precompiling frameworks like sass and less and architectural patterns like [BEM](http://bem.info/method/definitions/),  [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and [SMACCS](http://smacss.com/) which lead to combined framework definitions like [MVCSS](http://mvcss.github.io/) and [SMURF](http://railslove.com/blog/2012/11/09/taking-sass-to-the-next-level-with-smurf-and-extend).

Aside these ideas we have developed our frontend architecture on similar principles for years now, and did not want to bother anymore about how to name folders and structures in every project again and again. Out of this we tried to combine and compress the basic ideas around the aforementioned principles to some helpful generators, that provides a more or less complete filestructure for your css and some specific generators to add new css components for your modules, settings or even your font files. Unlike the core principles like BEM, OOCSS or SMACSS this framework is based on SASS/SCSS only, because (yeah, obvious i know :)) it is all about structuring/splitting your css code to encapsulated and reusable units.
