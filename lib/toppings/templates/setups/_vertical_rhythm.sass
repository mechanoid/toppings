/* We initialize a baseline or vertical grid with help of compass here.
 * For further information about it, you can take a look at this.
 * (http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/).
 *
 * It is important that font-size and vertical padding adjustments were implemented
 * with vertical rhythm helper only beyond this setup.
 *
 * NOTE: please keep in mind, that images have to be handled manually,
 * and that they can kill your vertical grid like they may do in horizontal grids.
 *
 * Please make sure, you really understood, how this works and which styles
 * are generated by the use of this helpers. (A good and bried summary is given
 * in this codeschool course http://sasstwo.codeschool.com/levels/4,
 * which i strongly recommend, to be sure, to have a good standing in these technics)
 *
 * Here are some examples for adjustments you can try.
 *
 * +adjust-font-size-to(50px)       // simply adjusting the fs
 *
 * (cause we adjusted the basic font size here, we have to provide
 * it in the following examples. Otherwise we can ommit the second parameter
 * of the helper functions)
 *
 * +adjust-leading-to(2, 50px)         // saying that an element take the space of two baselines, given a fs of 50px
 *
 * +leader(1, 50px)                 // upfront marging for elements
 * +padding-leader(1, 50px)         // upfront padding for elements
 * +trailer(1, 50px)                // afterwards margin
 * +padding-trailer(1, 50px)        // afterwards padding
 *
 * +rhythm(1, 1, 1, 1, 50xp)         // combination of leaders, trailers and the padding values (l, pl, pt, t, fs)
 *
 * +leading-border(10px, 1, 50px)    // upfront border in respect with the vertical rhythm
 * +trailing-border(10px, 1, 50px)   // afterwards border in respect with the vertical rhythm
 * +rhythm-borders(2px, 1, 50px)
